> Another star you fade away. Afraid our aim is out of sight; wanna see us alight. Where are you now? Was is all in our fantasy? Where are you now? Were you only imaginary? Where are you now? These shallow waters never met what I needed I'm letting go a deeper dive eternal silence of the sea. I'm breathing alive. where are you now?
under the bright but faded lights you've set my heart on fire. Where are you now? Atlantis under the sea where are you now? Another dream. The monster's running wild inside of me.... I'M FADED... I'M FADED so lost, I'M FADED... I'M FADED... so lost, I'M FADED
